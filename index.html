    <h1><a href="/">Campus from CAST</a></h1>

    <h2>Something remarkable is happening<br /> in the third sector...</h2>

    <p>Charities used to have limited access to technology. They relied on donated hardware and software, which quickly became outdated.
      Or they paid costly licensing fees that drained budgets. It felt like they didn't truly own the tools they depended on.</p>
    <p>Today, CAST is pioneering a new open-IP model - bringing enterprise-level technology to charities through a one-time fee.
      This gives nonprofits full ownership and control, while providing CAST a sustainable funding stream to continually improve products.</p>
    <p>For too long, charities lacked access to innovation. But open-IP can change that. We believe it enables stronger outcomes, 
      efficiency, and scale for nonprofits.</p> <p>That's why we built Campus. It's a place charities can access a growing marketplace of 
      open-IP products to own forever, with experts on hand providing ongoing guidance and support.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Pay once, own forever - one price for the software forever</li>
      <li>All the code is yours - 100% transparency into product design</li>
      <li>We host, you host, your choiece - full control and ownership</li>
      <li>Enterprise-grade capabilities, designed specifically for charities</li>
      <li>Ongoing support, hosting, training, and integration from our nonprofit experts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The first set of Campus products will launch Q1-2024, with many more in development. And by participating, your charity will shape future innovations.</p>
    <p>This open-IP journey is just beginning. We intend to challenge old charity technology models to bring nonprofits the modern tools they deserve. The post-licensing era for the sector is arriving.</p>

    <p>Come join us on Campus and see what's possible.</p>
